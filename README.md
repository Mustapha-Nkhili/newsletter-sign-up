## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- js

### Continued development

In future projects, there are several areas I want to continue focusing on and improving:

1. **JavaScript Interactivity:** I would like to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript to create more interactive and dynamic components. This includes exploring frameworks like React or Vue.js to build robust and efficient user interfaces.

1. **Accessibility:** I want to enhance my understanding of accessibility principles and techniques to ensure that my projects are usable by a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. I will strive to implement proper semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and consider keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

1. **Performance Optimization:** I aim to further optimize the performance of my projects by implementing best practices such as lazy loading images, minifying and compressing assets, and utilizing caching strategies. I want to explore tools like Webpack or Gulp to automate these optimization processes.

1. **Responsive Design Patterns:** While I have gained experience in responsive design, I want to explore more advanced techniques and design patterns. This includes mastering CSS Grid and Flexbox, as well as learning about newer layout approaches like CSS Grid Level 2 (subgrid) and CSS Container Queries.

1. **Testing and Debugging:** I plan to enhance my skills in testing and debugging to ensure the reliability and stability of my projects. This involves learning testing frameworks like Jest or Cypress and using browser developer tools effectively for debugging purposes.

1. **Design Principles:** I believe that improving my understanding of design principles will enhance my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. I will study color theory, typography, and layout principles to develop a better eye for design.

By focusing on these areas, I aim to continually improve my skills and deliver better quality projects in the future. Remember to remove this instructional note and replace it with your own plans for continued development.
